<p>With the eighth edition of the Amity International Model United Nations (AMIMUN’19) from
  Friday, the 18<sup>th</sup> , 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup>
  January to Sunday, the 20th January, 2019, Amity aims to consolidate AMIMUN’s worldwide recognition
  and its status as one of the top MUNs across the continent with the participation of delegates from across the world.<br><br>
  With our belief in harnessing excellence in the field of innovative education, whilst keeping the holistic
  approach intact, Amity strives to make AMIMUN’19 an experience that will uphold the mission of encouraging
  students to pursue futuristic frontiers with ideas that will change the world. The teaching philosophy of Amity
  particularly focuses on values and sanskars and also importantly, the understanding for close cross-cultural
  nuances. We believe that with such ideals, students will truly be able to pursue the path of complete
  development and grow to become the best example of themselves.
  <br><br>
  It is my belief that by encouraging students to organize and participate in such events, we push
  the boundaries of creativity and innovation, and help them in thinking out of the box. At
  AMIMUN’19, they will participate as diplomats representing members of the United Nations, and
  simulate various committees, agencies, specific organs, and programmes of United Nations. By
  immersing their minds in an environment full of ideas pertaining to real issues that the world faces
  today, students will get a unique opportunity to become familiar with global concerns and the
  working of the United Nations. Delegates attempt to resolve regional and international problems
  in a powerful yet engaging manner through this entire process of debate and negotiations.<br><br>

All participants, from India as well as from diverse regions of the globe such as Indonesia, Russia,
Uzbekistan, Nepal, Cameroon, Morocco, Taiwan, South Africa, Bangladesh, and Canada, will find
AMIMUN'19 to be a convention where their unique talents and capabilities will contribute towards
their professional growth, and would be important for learning that they are capable of creating
a world where everyone can lead prosperous and fulfilling lives.<br><br>
AMIMUN'19 will be a platform for the growth of the youth. As the leaders of tomorrow unite at this
conference, they will hone their skills in leadership, teamwork, expository and persuasive writing, debating
and negotiations, and learn the significance of these skills for personal development and a successful future.<br><br>
I convey my appreciation to Dr. Alpana Kakkar, Chairperson, AMIMUN '19 & Deputy Dean, AUUP and
the excellent team consisting of its diligent members: Ms. Deviena Srivastava, Secretary General,
AMIMUN'19, Mr. Yash Bhati, Director General, AMIMUN'19, Mr. Sreerag Marar, Chef de Cabinet,
AMIMUN'19, and the ever-supportive Organizing Committee and students. I also compliment
Dr. Balvinder Shukla, Vice Chancellor, AUUP, for all her support and guidance to make this event
successful. Further, the continuous guidance and path-showing advice from our visionary Chancellor,
Dr. Atul Chauhan has been greatly motivating and inspiring for ensuring the success of AMIMUN '19.<br><br>
I welcome all the participants and wish them a pleasant stay at our campus. I am confident that they
will cherish the uniqueness of this experience of the Amity Universe as they participate in AMIMUN’19.
I wish AMIMUN’19 a great success.</p>

<p>
It gives me immense pleasure that Amity University is organizing the Amity International Model United Nations (AMIMUN’19) on the 18th, 19th and 20th of January, 2019 and will host brilliant minds from leading universities of India and the world. 
<br><br>
With the aim of promoting a spirit of discourse as a means of raising issues and conflict resolution, AMIMUN’19 this year is "Débat. Discuter. Décider”. It is a Conference that will provide a practical learning environment, the benefits of which can be significant in the journey of the participating students who aspire to become leaders that will impact society. 
<br><br>
At Amity University, we always strive to go a step further and make progress. We have done exactly that this year with by collaborating with the United Nations Information Centre for India and Bhutan, Amnesty International and Doctors Without Borders, in order to effectively impart the knowledge of global affairs, diplomacy, and international policy to the students and to add an aspect of authenticity to their experience. 
<br><br>
The international repute of AMIMUN continues to surge higher with delegates applying from all corners of the world including Russia, Morocco, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Uzbekistan, Nepal, Cameroon, Taiwan, South Africa and Canada. Not only will AMIMUN’19 nurture intellectualism, but will also encourage people-to-people ties between the nations of the world by giving the diverse participants the chance to build long-lasting meaningful friendships. 
<br><br>
I welcome the distinguished guests at AMIMUN19 and am certain that they will serve as role models for the students participating in the Conference. The vast experience and inspiration expressed in their words will help the delegates realize the significance of skills such as strategic thinking and critical analysis as well as the importance of positivity, humility, and compassion in their paths to making a real difference in the world. 
<br><br>
AMIMUN’19 presents itself as a platform where students develop an awareness of the role of the United Nations and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals which envision the world in 2030. Considering that the participants are the leaders of tomorrow, Amity takes initiatives such as AMIMUN to prepare the future generation to combine empathy with aptitude. 
<br><br>
Owing to the efforts of the dedicated members of the Organizing Committee and the team of assiduous students, AMIMUN’19 promises to be a conference of International standards. I extend my best wishes for AMIMUN’19 to be a resounding success and hope that it builds upon the foundation laid by its outstanding seven previous editions.

<br>

<p>
I am delighted to welcome you to the eigth edition of the Amity International Model United Nations Conference  to be held on January 18th , 19th   and 20th , 2019 at Amity University Campus, Sector-125, Noida, U.P., India. 
<br><br>
Combining its ideals of providing total, integrated and trans-cultural quality education through a progressive approach, and expanding the horizons of knowledge, Amity presents AMIMUN’19 as a means to encourage interaction among students from across the globe and provide them the opportunity to take part in diplomatic discussions on compelling issues. 
<br><br>
A Model United Nations is an academic simulation of the various proceedings of the United Nations, with students representing various countries. Not only has the popularity of MUNs soared, they have also established themselves at prestigious platforms for inculcating in students myriad skills ranging from leadership to communication. 
<br><br>
Since its inception in 2011, AMIMUN has helped participants from across the world to witness the extreme relevance of learning international affairs and understanding the working and significance of the United Nations. Peace-making, security, conflict prevention, social progress, better living standards and human rights are some of the numerous aspects that are emphasized to the youth at AMIMUN. 
<br><br>
The theme for AMIMUN’19 is “ Debat. Discuster. Decider”, to ensure that youth take charge and become leaders of tomorrow.  At this international conference, we aim to expose students to a global perspective through a spark that will stir nations to come together and create a world where we find innovation and peaceful co-existence going hand in hand. This MUN will be a unique convention, with over 300 delegates from 70 colleges from all around the world, which will give birth to a new generation of strong, confident and, above all, compassionate leaders. 
<br><br>
I take this excellent opportunity to convey my best wishes to the delegates from all over the world and wish them a great learning experience as well as a pleasant stay in Delhi NCR. 
<br><br>
I am certain that the hard work and commitment of the organising committee members and the Secretariat will make AMIMUN’19 a glorious success!

<p>
<br>
It gives me great pleasure to send this message to Amity International Model United Nations 2019 organized by the Amity University, Noida. 
<br><br>
The United Nations takes pride in, and extensively works towards engaging with youth to promote the 5 P’s People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace, and Partnership, a key feature to attain Agenda 2030 for sustainable development. Through its collaborations with Model UNs in India, we endeavour to carry forward these values of Agenda 2030 to promote a peaceful, equal and a sustainable environment for all. 
<br><br>
The AMIMUN’19 comes at a crucial time, with the United Nations and all Member States emphasizing the importance of the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals. The 17 Goals try to achieve a peaceful and sustainable model of development that is inclusive and leaves no one behind. The youth can play a very important role in making sure that the benefits of these goals reach all. This principle of ‘leave no one behind’ should play an important role for all the delegates participating in AMIMUN’18 and they should aim to tackle the global issues being discussed in the Model UN through an equitable, inclusive approach. 
<br><br>
This Model UN simulation gives you the opportunity to understand the working of the United Nations system and the complex international challenges it is trying to address. I hope you get an opportunity to not only think about global challenges but also come up with innovative solutions to deal with these vast global challenges. 
<br><br>
I would like to congratulate the organizing team of AMIMUN’19 for putting together this conference and I am certain that your MUN will bring students closer to the universal ideals and values of the United Nations. 
<br><br>
My Best Wishes.

Greetings!<br>

It is my honor to welcome each participant  to the eighth edition of the Amity International Model United Nations 2019- AMIMUN’19.
