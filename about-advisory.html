<p>MUN is the occasion to live the amazing experience of representing a country in a truly international and multicultural environment, debating over hot topics of
the current geopolitical agenda, learning to negotiate and compromise to reach consensus, making new friends. No one needs to be a professional of the
international relations, or on diplomacy, it is all about learning. Today you might be delegates in your College, you're learning, getting familiar with the
concept, its rules, but who knows maybe tomorrow you will be sitting in New-York or Geneva at the UN's headquarters, small steps guide you to higher
places. AMIMUN'19 is your opportunity to learn how to be a delegate and to feel the atmosphere of a MUN. Being helped, supported and surrounded by the
AMITY team, which this year is organizing its 8th MUN but also boosted by Indonesia MUN, Young Leaders'Consortium and UNIC.</p>

<p>The Model United Nations is an incredibly powerful platform for the youth to understand how the world works and deals with its problems. We cannot, as
future world leaders, suggest to build walls as solutions to security threats. We must, instead, find ways to, if not resolve, then at least to endure them together
by building bridges and forging lasting and incorruptible relationships. Let's focus on resolving issues that will be discussed over the duration of the
conference instead of going back and forth with cause and effect for an unwarranted period of time. I am confident that AMIMUN will prove to be a fine
example of the youth's capability to influence and bring about change, as it always has been. I look forward to watching AMIMUN achieve new milestones
and setting examples for all other institutions to follow.</p>

<p>MUNs are a powerful tool to create ripples in the mind of the youth about issues further away from home. It propagates the idea of global community and helps
young minds broaden their perspectives on real world issues that need our attention TODAY. I have been associated with AMIMUN since 2014 and before it, I
was ignorant to how powerful a medium it can be to spark important discussions and ideas. Since its conception, it has grown every year to become
bigger and better. It has always realized the importance of difficult conversations and unconventional committees. I feel honored to be on the
advisory panel of AMIMUN'19, and hope that it continues to strive to make a real difference.</p>

<p>My journey with MUNs began with AMIMUN 2011, and since then there's been no looking back. I consider it an honor to be a part of AMIMUN'19 as an Advisor. I'm
really proud how AMIMUN has become a legacy which has always strived to introduce new ideas, in the form of unconventional committees, which in turn
open up an entirely new side of role-based debating. I've been associated with AMIMUN as a delegate, as the Secretary General in 2014, a member of the
Executive Board, and as a member of the Advisory Panel, and thus, I can confidently say that AMIMUN has been growing with each year, ever since its
inception. I'm really excited about AMIMUN'19 as I'm confident this MUN is going to be an absolutely delightful experience for everyone. Cheers!</p>

<p>Despite the development that the world has witnessed in the past century, the list of issues that plague nations has risen simultaneously. The nature of conflicts has changed from being among nations to being within nations. Economies have become the bedrock of the world, their rise and fall affecting the quality of life the world over. In this moment, United Nations holds immense significance as the source of negotiations and deliberations upon such issues. I’ve been associated with AMIMUN since 2013 and I consider it an honour to be a part of AMIMUN’19 as an advisor. It gives me immense pleasure inviting you all to be a part of AMIMUN’19 to witness the most extravagant conference of the year. AMIMUN conferences are unique for providing an international atmosphere for delegates with a variety of experience. The secretariat and the organising committee are constantly setting higher standards to make every year even more exciting and challenging for both new and returning delegates. I look forward to this magnanimous experience!</p>

<p>Some endeavours don't start with much promise but end up giving you memories which shape you and help you become an entirely different person. For me it was AMIMUN.
<br>
After 4 long years AMIMUN has become an integral part of my life today. Having started with it from the moment I started college, it wouldn't be unfair to say that AMIMUN has been my entire college life, and the best investment of my time, energy and passion. AMIMUN has never been just a conference for any of the people associated with it. It is much more than just an international conference. AMIMUN is an emotion.
<br>
On behalf of the Secretariat and other members of the Advisory Board, I extend a very warm welcome to all the delegates, members of the Executive Board and the International Press.
I hope each one of you connects with AMIMUN the same way as all of the Organising team members have, and that you take away as much learning and memories from the conference as possible. Wishing the entire Organising team and the Secretariat of AMIMUN'19 the very best for the upcoming months. Looking forward to see the magic unfold in January.</p>

    <p>Now in its eigth year, AMIMUN has grown leaps and bounds from its humble beginnings in 2011. Delegates from all over India and abroad, will engage in
    well-directed debates in any one of our seven committees which are being simulated this year. I expect AMIMUN 2019 to leave a lasting impression on your
    hearts and minds long after the conference comes to an end. It is indeed my honour and privilege to welcome you all to the 8th edition of Amity

        <p>Model United Nations is a plausible stage for the youth to learn how the world is integrated and why it is indispensable to work in coordination amidst Nations. It’s been 4 years that I have fastened myself with AMIMUN and discerning the growth I can assure delegates, this year also it is going to set new standards and benchmarks. I feel prodigious being the advisor of AMIMUN’19 and on behalf of AMIMUN family I would like to invite all the delegates to partake in the conference and experience how influential MUNs can be to scintillate consequential dialogues and notions.</p>

<p>In this era of globalization, becoming globally aware is more important than ever. And this is where MUN helps the students, it gives them a platform which helps them learn about world issues and voice their opinions and become more globally concerned citizens. MUN helps you build leadership skills, diplomatic skills, confidence and most of all it enhances your public speaking skills.
<br>
I have been a part of the AMIMUN conference since 2014 and I feel privileged to be part AMIMUN'19 as an advisor. I can easily say that this is one of the best conference not only in the Delhi circuit but in the country as well. The hospitality, logistics, everything is marked to perfection at AMIMUN and it gets better with every passing year.
Finally the level of debate which you will experience at AMIMUN will make you want to come back again next year. I am eagerly looking forward to this phenomenal conference.</p>

<p>It takes enough courage to speak your opinions and one who gets the courage to speak, changes the world. MUNs are nothing but an apt explanation of the same. With an approach to diplomacy and the determination to sustain peacekeeping globally, these simulations of the United Nations Diaspora have the exact same impact on a young diplomat’s mind.
<br>
AMIMUN has been an integral part of my life and today when I look down the road I have travelled, I give a major credit to AMIMUN for paving that path.
<br>
AMIMUN’19 cannot make me less enthused about world class debating with respect to global peacekeeping and I’m honoured to be a part of the advisory board for the conference. I encourage young orators to be a part of AMIMUN’19 and take advantage of the learning opportunities that it will provide.</p>

conferences including Corporate Meet'16, Confluence'16, ACM to name a few. I
feel privileged to be part of AMIMUN'19 as an advisor for Web Operations and
looks forward to guiding the conference towards the best in the history of
AMIMUN. AMIMUN has always strived to bring out the best of diplomacy
amongst youth and with the onset of the seventh edition, the Secretary General
has established numerous new advents that will create an enigmatic experience
for all the participants. I wish all the very best to the team for a successful
conference.</p>
